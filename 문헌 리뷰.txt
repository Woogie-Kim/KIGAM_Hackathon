Fluid pressure in the PDG (P-PDG): sensor closest to the reservoir and which usually fails due to the level of hostility of the environment. 
Furthermore, as the PDG is a piece of equipment that is screwed onto the production column itself, in case of failure of this sensor, 
its replacement is considered costly and risky, as it demands the replacement of the production column itself;

Pressure and temperature of the fluid in the TPT (P-TPT and T-TPT): sensors internal to the ANM (Árvore de Natal Molhada, Wet Christmas Tree)
whose reliability is considered good by professionals in the field of Oil Lifting and Flow;

Upstream fluid pressure to the Production Choke valve (P-MON-CKP): sensor also considered of good reliability, when present;

Fluid temperature downstream of the Production Choke valve (T-JUS-CKP): in this position there may be fluids from several different wells, 
but this sensor is considered relevant because in general there is no fluid temperature sensor upstream of the Production Choke.

"Essas três variáveis adicionais são ligadas a sensores posicionados na linha de serviço e podem ser úteis no prognóstico de anomalias que 
se manifestam levação tanto natural quanto artificial."
